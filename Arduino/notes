finding block method psuedo code:

rotate to -90 (unless going NE)
rotate -90 (to -180) degrees while scanning for objects
    if object detected, verify it is a block, not a dowel/ball

if no object detected, return to -90 degrees
go forward 1 foot while scanning scanning left
    if object detected, verify it is a block, not a dowel/ball

if no object detected, retreat 1 foot. turn -90 (to -180).
go forward 1 foot while scanning right
    if object detected, verify it is a block, not a dowel/ball

return found object distance, angle to it
