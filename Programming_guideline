arduino:

global variables:
dowel locations
block locations
mothership location
state manager


pathing function(location) 	//finds path to location ignoring obstacles

runPath function 		//executes path 

map location 		//gets current location and keeps up with it

map location helper	//after movement update location

receive locations	//updates global variables with information from py

state manager		//what info needed from pi?

helper motor functions 	//runs move motor forward, sideways etc to go along path

pick up block

time to deposit 	//??? series of passing information back and forth
	//mothership letters are static but orientation is random. find letter then interpret other letters 

rotate Light r sensor on a servo and make an isValid movement function to preemptively interrupt movement


Pi:

Get mothership location
get dowel location
get block locations
send locations(mother, dowel, block)
state manager				//my turn?
determine letter			//determines letter of block
send the 	letter				/sends letter

sloke:
	map location based on distance travelled
	parse json with block information
	read json file
	come up with a way to find a mothership
